# One last stop before the plan can be set into motion!
# It's up to you to help Senick get the average size of these yetis.

# Find all the Yetis using 'findByType':

# Implement the averageSize function from scratch:
def averagesize(targets):
    sum = 0 
    len = 0
    for yeti in targets:
        if yeti.type == "yeti":
            sum += yeti.size
            len +=1
    return sum/len
# Say the average size of the yetis:
enemies = hero.findEnemies()
hero.say(averagesize(enemies))
