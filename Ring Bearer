# Make a circle of soldiers around the peasant!
# We give you two functions to help with this:

# findSoldierOffset figures out the position a soldier should stand at in relation to the peasant.
# The first argument 'soldiers' should be an array of your soldiers.
# The second argument 'i' is the index of the soldier (in soldiers) you want to find the position for.

# This function does the math to determine the offset a soldier should stand at.
def radialToCartesian(radius, degrees):
    radians = Math.PI / 180 * degrees
    xOffset = radius * Math.cos(radians)
    yOffset = radius * Math.sin(radians)
